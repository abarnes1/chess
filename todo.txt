1. try to update game_state to use internal array of squares instead of a piece array
  a. easier to generate FEN output
  b. faster lookups
  c. may make it necessary for pieces to not know about their position otherwise it is
     duplicated
2. figure out where to best put PGN fields
3. rework castling to use castling pairs instead of overcomplicated math
